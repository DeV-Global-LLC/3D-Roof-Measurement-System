This report details the technical implementation of a 3D Roof Measurement System that combines multiple geospatial data sources and machine learning techniques to analyze roof characteristics. The system provides accurate measurements of roof area, slope, and type classification through an API interface.
2. System Architecture
2.1 Core Components

Data Acquisition Layer: Integrates with USGS NAIP, OpenTopography, and OpenStreetMap APIs

Processing Layer: Handles LiDAR point cloud processing, roof detection, and metric calculation

Machine Learning Layer: Utilizes Detectron2 for roof segmentation

API Layer: Provides REST and WebSocket interfaces for client interaction

2.2 Technology Stack

Backend: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance API services

Geospatial Processing: Geopandas, PDAL, Rasterio, OSMnx

Machine Learning: Detectron2 (PyTorch) with GPU acceleration

Visualization: Matplotlib, Open3D

Data Sources: USGS NAIP, OpenTopography LiDAR, OpenStreetMap

3. Key Techniques and Implementation
3.1 Data Acquisition and Processing
3.1.1 Multi-Source Data Integration

USGS NAIP Imagery: High-resolution aerial imagery (1m resolution) for visual reference

OpenTopography LiDAR: 3D point cloud data (COP30 DEM at 1m resolution)

OpenStreetMap: Building footprints for spatial reference

Implementation Rationale: Combining these datasets provides both 2D visual context and 3D structural data, enabling comprehensive roof analysis.
3.1.2 Asynchronous Data Streaming

 ```python
async def stream_file(url: str, websocket: WebSocket = None):
    # Implementation handles large file downloads with progress reporting
```

Why Used: Enables efficient handling of large geospatial datasets while providing real-time progress updates to clients.
3.2 Roof Detection and Analysis
3.2.1 LiDAR Point Cloud Processing

 ```python
def detect_roof(lidar_path: str, building_polygon: Polygon):
    # Extracts roof points using height percentile filtering
```
Technique: 90th percentile height filtering isolates roof points from building point clouds.
3.2.2 Plane Fitting and Slope Calculation

 ```python
def calculate_roof_metrics(roof_points: np.ndarray):
    # Uses linear regression to fit a plane and calculate slope
```
Algorithm: Ordinary Least Squares regression fits a plane to roof points, with slope derived from plane normal vector.
3.2.3 Roof Area Calculation

 ```python
hull = ConvexHull(roof_points[:, :2])
area = hull.volume  # in 2D, volume is area
```
Method: Convex hull approximation provides robust area estimation even with irregular roof shapes.
3.3 Machine Learning Integration
3.3.1 Detectron2 Model Configuration

 ```python
cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH_TEST = 0.7
cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.NUM_CLASSES = config.NUM_ROOF_CLASSES
```
Model Choice: Mask R-CNN architecture is ideal for roof segmentation tasks due to its ability to handle complex shapes and provide instance segmentation.
3.4 Performance Optimization
3.4.1 GPU Acceleration

 ```python
if config.USE_GPU:
    cfg.MODEL.DEVICE = "cuda"
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True
```
Benefit: Provides 10-50x speedup for ML inference compared to CPU-only operation.
3.4.2 Memory Management

```python
def clear_gpu_memory():
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
    gc.collect()
```

Necessity: Prevents memory leaks during continuous processing of multiple requests.
3.4.3 Caching Mechanism

```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=config.CACHE_SIZE)
async def fetch_usgs_naip(bbox: tuple):
```

Impact: Reduces redundant API calls for frequently requested geographic areas.
3.5 API Design
3.5.1 Dual Interface Approach

    REST API: Traditional request-response for simple integrations

    WebSocket: Real-time progress streaming for complex operations

Advantage: Caters to different client requirements with optimal protocols.
3.5.2 Progress Reporting

```python
class ProgressUpdate(BaseModel):
    stage: str
    progress: float
    message: str
```
User Experience: Provides transparency for long-running operations that may take several minutes.
