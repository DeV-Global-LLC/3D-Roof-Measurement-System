# 3D Roof Measurement System
### AI-powered API that automatically measures roof dimensions


Key Improvements:

    Proper DeepRoof Model Integration:

        Added model initialization at startup

        Implemented proper roof detection using Detectron2's mask prediction

        Added confidence scoring for predictions

    Enhanced Roof Detection:

        Processes the mask output to create a clean polygon

        Added contour simplification to reduce complexity

        Better error handling for detection failures

    Improved Metrics Calculation:

        More robust LiDAR point cloud processing

        Better area calculation using pixel dimensions from GeoTIFF

        Added roof type classification based on slope

    API Enhancements:

        Added confidence score to the response

        Better error handling and logging

        More detailed documentation

    Performance Optimizations:

        Parallel data fetching

        Background cleanup tasks

        Simplified polygon processing

To use this code, you'll need to:

    Have a trained DeepRoof model (Detectron2 format)

    Set the appropriate environment variables for API keys

    Install all required dependencies (Detectron2, PDAL, Open3D, etc.)

The model will automatically use GPU if available, falling back to CPU if not.
